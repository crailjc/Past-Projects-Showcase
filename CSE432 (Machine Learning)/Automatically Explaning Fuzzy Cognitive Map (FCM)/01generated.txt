The person is a child of negligible obesity level. They display negligible knowledge, and report very low amounts of stress. They use  doses of antidepressants to treat their very low depression. Their income level is very small, and they maintain a negligible level of exercise and very small food intake. Their physical health is negligible, and their belief in personal responsibility is very low. They have a very small negative perception of fatness, and a negligiblenate based on weight.
Our model predicts that our person will have a  in antidepressants. There is predicted to be a very small growth in physical health, negligible rise in exercise, and very small increase in obesity. A very small increase in food consumption and noticeably low growth in weight discrimination is anticipated. The model predicts noticeably low rise in personal responsibility and an negligible increaseception of fatness.

The given person is a child consuming  doses of antidepressants to treat very small levels of depression. The person has a negligible belief in personal responsibility and participates in noticeably low amounts of exercise. The person has a negligible negative perception of fatness. In addition, with food intake being very small, income being negligible, and knowledge being very low, the person exhibits noticeably low obesity and negligible physical health. The person also endures very small stress and very smalln.
The model predicts a  in antidepressant consumption and a very low rise in physical health for the given person. The model predicts very small increase in obesity and very small growth in food intake. Based on the model, the person will experience an very small increase in weight discrimination and very small increase in personal responsibility, and a noticeably low growth in the person’s negative perception of fatness and an very low increasecise.

The person is a child of very low obesity level. They display very small knowledge, and report negligible amounts of stress. They use negligible doses of antidepressants to treat their negligible depression. Their income level is noticeably low, and they maintain a very small level of exercise and negligible food intake. Their physical health is very small, and their belief in personal responsibility is negligible. They have a very low negative perception of fatness, and a very smallnate based on weight.
According to the model, the person's antidepressant use will very low rise, they experience a noticeably low rise in obesity. Their weight discrimination and negative fatness perception will very small rise, and their food intake and physical health will negligible growth. Their exercise level will negligible growth, and their belief in personal responsibility will negligible rise

The current client is a child taking noticeably low doses of antidepressants to treat an very small level of depression. The client exhibits very low belief in personal responsibility and engages in very small exercise. The client identifies their negative perception of fatness as negligible. The client consumes an noticeably low amount of food and maintains a negligible income and noticeably low knowledge. Exhibiting negligible obesity and noticeably low physical health, the client experiences very small stress and negligiblen.
